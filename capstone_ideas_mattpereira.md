# Capstone Ideas

1. Crypto API
   * Try to build basic functionality of watchlist where users can create their own list of crypto currencies to follow
   * Using crypto API to fetch current and past price data. Try to display in graph format
   * Fetch informational/educational article links to display

2. NASA API
   * Allow users to search and save their favorite images in a profile
   * Display high res Astronomy picture of the day on landing page
   * Fetch images/information about asteroids 

3. Deck of Cards API
   * Use api as engine to create a card game.
   * Big swing would be something like texas holdem with multiple players and bets and totals for accumulated chips
   * Smaller project could be crazy eights or maybe solitaire

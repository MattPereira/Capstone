    <p class="lead text-white text-center">Founded in 2013?, the No Fun League began as simple snake redraft league amongst a small group of friends. In 2020?, the league converted to an auction draft with multi-year keepers. Each year, the managers compete to win the championship and avoid the ever-humiliating Toilet Bowl.</p>

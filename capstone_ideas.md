   * Sleeper API provides all relevant data to my personal fantasy football league
   * Will be able to make pages to display all rosters, playoff results, and past draftboards
   * Will also build functionality to handle league voting on new rules
   * Also provides opporunity to collaborate later with league members who are software engineers
  
2. Crypto API
   * Try to build basic functionality of watchlist where users can create their own list of crypto currencies to follow
   * Using crypto API to fetch current and past price data. Try to display in graph format
   * Fetch informational/educational article links to display

3. NASA API
